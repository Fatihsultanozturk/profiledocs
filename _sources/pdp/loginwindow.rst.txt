loginwindow
===========

The loginwindow plugin is surprisingly not just responsible for the loginwindow.

Also the payload domains ``loginwindow`` and ``com.apple.loginitems.managed`` are actually in the MCX pdp.

Domains
-------

- com.apple.loginwindow
- .GlobalPreferences
- com.apple.screensaver
- com.apple.mcxloginscripts
