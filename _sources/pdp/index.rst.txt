Profile Domain Plugins
======================

This is basically a list of **.profileDomainPlugin** plugins, which I'm currently using to document the responsiblity
of each PayloadType.

Profile domain plugins live in ``/System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/PlugIns``. More recently
as of Sierra some have been added to ``/System/Library/ConfigurationProfiles/PlugIns``.
