Parental Controls - Content Filter
==================================

This payload enables you to control access to sites through parental controls.
As with the System Preference pane you can use two approaches:

- A simple whitelist, which blocks out everything except for the list.
- A content filter with custom blacklist and whitelist.

**whitelistEnabled** and **useContentFilter** are mutually exclusive.
